# maxwell_3d_with_plots Example - Needs Update

This example currently does not compile and requires significant refactoring to work with the current API.

## Issues:

1. **4D Array Indexing**: Maxwell fields use 4D arrays (3 components + 3 spatial dimensions) but the current indexing assumes 3D
2. **Plotly API Changes**: Uses outdated Plotly API (Scene, ColorScalePalette variants that no longer exist)
3. **Domain Structure**: May need updates to match the current MaxwellDomain API

## Recommendations:

- Rewrite using the current WaveArray API and proper Maxwell field handling
- Update to use current plotly-rs API
- Consider whether this functionality should be a separate tool or integrated differently

## Status: NOT MAINTAINED

This example is preserved for reference but is not currently functional. Users interested in Maxwell equation visualization should refer to the working Helmholtz visualization examples as a starting point.
